1)	I am mostly interested in the dev team, because my greatest goal is to become a game developer, so being a part of the dev team can be a great beginning of that journey.
2)	Java, because it is easy and efficient for me to write logical problems in that language.
3)	A linked list is something like an array, except you can’t access it via index. Linked lists have nodes which mainly consist of two parts the address to the other node and the value of the element in that node. Linked lists have both advantages and disadvantages. For deletions and additions of other values into the list linked lists can become very handy.
4)	First, I would ask them to line up so that the first who got into the store is at the beginning and the last one is at the very end, then I would take the orders and most importantly I would work very fast and if I have a chance I would ask for help from another worker.
5)	I would write a word on a piece of paper.
6)	I would test the overall performance of the web page.
7)	Go over that list if the next value is greater than the previous one by 1 ten that’s ok if not then there is the missing value (assuming the list is sorted).
8)	Consider 360/12 (hours) = 30 (the angle between two numbers) but also consider the fact that it’s 3:20 so the small arrow should have moved a little, so we take 2/3 (20 is 2/3 of 30) of 30 = “20”. 
9)	If that number is divisible by two as many times as it takes to be fully divided by two (the last division is 2/2 = 1), then it is a power of two. In other words, if we can represent that number in 2n form then it is a power of two.
10)	Go over the list and for each two values check if they are equal if so remove one of them.
11)	Put the characters of the string in an array of size string. Length () and then go over that array with nested two loops. One loop starts from 0 and the second one from 1 until it reaches the end of the array it compares all the characters with the character at the index of 0 and then increment 0 by 1 and so on… if we get a match then we don’t have unique characters, otherwise we are OK.
12)	Pick the first and last characters and swap them, then take the second first and the previous character of the last and swap them and do this recursively until finishing the whole string.
13)	Put the characters separately in an array, if all of them are unique then don’t do anything since it won’t reduce the size, otherwise for every additional same character increment the counter (which is initially 1) by 1 and print it next to the character before moving to the next character.
14)	We should go over the array and check if the number is 0 or 1, if it’s 0 then place it at the beginning (index of 0) and for the next 0s place that at the next index (incrementing the index by 1) and if it’s 1 place it at the end (array. Length - 1) and for the next 1s decrement the size by 1.
15)	I would design a vending machine in a way that the back of the vending machine would consist of pushing objects that push the item slightly whenever its number is called, so behind each item there is one of those pushing objects and each of them have a unique number which corresponds with the numbers on the order taker.
16)	It’s a lightbulb it will break if I drop it even from my height, so the 0/1 floor will be the answer.
17)	I would place each pillar in the corner of the two walls so that the angle between the pillar and each wall is 45, obviously if we have four walls, then we have four corners for our four pillars.
18)	Four.
